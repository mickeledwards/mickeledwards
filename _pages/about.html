        <p>I originally studied computer engineering. Throughout that, I developed both a methodological mindset and a love for creating things from scratch. With my need to control every last detail, I found that no readymade website builders catered towards my needs. Taking my previous experience in working with web design, I was able to find a good build system that works for me.</p><p>I am using a static site generator titled <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll.</a> This allows me to take parts and pieces that I've written and collate them into fully working webpages without needing to rewrite common parts, like the footer or navigation bar. </p>
