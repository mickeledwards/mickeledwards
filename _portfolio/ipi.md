description: From acid attacks to agricultural spills, contamination is a major issue that is often overlooked. Unfortunately, the current products and services on the market are not inclusively designed and are hard to understand in an event of an emergency, even for an able-bodied adult. This design seeks to develop a more inclusive system of decontamination procedures that will take less time to carry out and ultimately save lives.
