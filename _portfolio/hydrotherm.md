description:  A hydrothermal vent is "a hot spring, on the foor of the ocean [...] where heated fuids emerge from fissures in the Earthâ€™s crust." </br> This natural formation of heat rising is being pulled into a domestic space heater. The internal elements are based around the inner-workings of a hairdryer and rearranged to form a sleek and stylized home good.
