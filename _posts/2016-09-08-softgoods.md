### Mood Board
A soft and organic form was focused on, not only to remove uncomfortable hard edges, but also to give a more soothing form. Three main forms were explored: a lobed shape that fits on the back of the neck, a coral shape that would allow airflow to the face when asleep and a pebble shape. The pebble shape was chosen, as it was the most versitile and pillow-like. From here, a series of tufted stitched semicircles were added to the top of this stone shape to emulate the ripples of a stone tossed into a pond.
