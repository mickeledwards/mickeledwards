## Project Brief

>### apply and further explore methods and tools to design a soft goods product, allowing incoming INDD students a smooth transition into the program supporting the demanding INDD schedule and lifestyle

From here, market research was performed, and a gap in the current market was found. The product being ideated on would be a sleep aid that both worked in the night to allow the user to fall asleep, as well as gently waking the user in the morning.

## Problem Finding and Research
When looking at the typical days of the students interviewed, it was evident that they all shared a commonality of having problems sleeping, which included generally restless or late nights. From here, the problem statement of _**how might we improve the quality of sleep for an active college student**_ was found.

## Mood Board
A soft and organic form was focused on, not only to remove uncomfortable hard edges, but also to give a more soothing form. Three main forms were explored: a lobed shape that fits on the back of the neck, a coral shape that would allow airflow to the face when asleep and a pebble shape. The pebble shape was chosen, as it was the most versitile and pillow-like. From here, a series of tufted stitched semicircles were added to the top of this stone shape to emulate the ripples of a stone tossed into a pond.
